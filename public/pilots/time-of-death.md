Andrea Harrison. Born in Ras Shamra: home planet to Harrison Armory. She is a descendent of a branch of the family that pursued pharmacology and medicine rather than mechs and intergalactic weapons. Her family is not quiet as rich in comparison but still a political heavy weight in the sphere of Ras Shamra. She knows some of the extended family related to the Armory who like to brag of their "universal" importance.

Her great grandfather founded the Research, Development, and Implementation (RDI) campus on the planet specific to fast cloning and its medical uses. Then, using his fortune created by RDI, he built the Harrison University Teaching Hospital: first in its class for high tech medicine. Primum non nocere *"except for clones" whisper many*

Fifth generation doctor and the last true non-cloned daughter (or so she believes). Her parents strived to give her every opportunity and Andrea strived to make them proud. Yet, despite all of her parents expectations, and her desire to be a medical doctor: she was constantly at the bottom of her class, and constantly jeered at by classmates envious of her status. Rumors surrounded her: people believing she was only where she was due to her families money and prestige. She continued to try, studying late into the night, hiring the best tutors, but it wasn't until the final test after medical school, the practical portion of the Ras Shamra medical degree, that she finally listened to her destiny

No books were allowed, no access to the omninet, no writing implements. Just her and the patient stretched wide before her. And she failed - the worst outcome for her patient - death.  No one: no one had ever killed their patient during the practical, but she had. With shaking fingers she administered the wrong drug. A seizure came, the patient fell to the floor and stopped breathing, she screamed, checked a pulse and started chest compressions, the watching teachers rushed into the testing room, endotracheal tubes went flying, nurse androids attempted to catheterize, more injectable drugs. Bloody foam bubbled out of the patients mouth. 

They made her say it, "Time of death." 

Humiliated, she hid from the news-bots and was sent to the headquarters of the Harrison Armory to be filed away as a familial failure. That is where she found the old, neglected Everest mech, pushed in the back corner for parts.

She was never good at anything in her life but she was good at driving her mech. A natural pilot and soon - a natural killer. Lancer, soon hired by union as a special circumstance.

"I might not help people by healing them but maybe, just maybe I can help by harming those who would harm them...."
